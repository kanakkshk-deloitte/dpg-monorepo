The monorepo keeps shared runtime logic in `packages/*`. Each package has a narrow role and is meant to be consumed by apps such as `apps/api`.

Most readers should start with the higher-level guides first:

- [What Is DPG?](/)
- [Architecture](/concepts/architecture)
- [Network Schema Authoring Guide](/schemas/authoring)
- [API Overview](/apps/api)

## At a glance

- `packages/auth`: Better Auth setup, plugin wiring, and unified OTP support
- `packages/config`: env schemas, allowed-origin helpers, and network runtime helpers
- `packages/database`: Drizzle ref tables, partition helpers, and base SQL scripts
- `packages/notification`: HMAC notification client, auth header helpers, and provider-facing types
- `packages/match_score`: HMAC match score client, provider-specific clients, and scoring request/response types
- `packages/schemas`: Zod export, API schemas, and schema fetching

Checked-in example network configs, Postman collections, and API walkthroughs live under `examples/`.

## How to read the package layout

Start with `packages/config` if you are working on runtime setup or environment handling.

Start with `packages/database` if you are working on tables, partitioning, or item/event storage.

Start with `packages/schemas` if you are changing request validation, network config shape, or external schema loading.

Start with `packages/auth` if you are changing login, OTP, API key flows, or Better Auth integration.
