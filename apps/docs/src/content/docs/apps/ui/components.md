## Design System

`components/ui/*` contains shadcn/Radix primitives: buttons, cards, dialogs, drawers, popovers, selects, sidebar, skeletons, toggles, tooltips, calendar, inputs, labels, and separators.

For a custom product UI, the highest-value reusable components are `SchemaForm`, `DomainCard`, `CardFieldsFromSchema`, `ActionHandler`, `ActionModal`, and `MapView`.
