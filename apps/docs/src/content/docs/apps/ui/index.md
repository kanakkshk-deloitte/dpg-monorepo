The UI app lives in `apps/ui`. It is a React 19 + Vite frontend that renders network browsing, profile forms, cards, maps, action modals, and action-management screens from DPG network schema documents.

The important split is:

- **network schema driven**: domains, item schemas, public fields, action requirement forms, and network configs
- **application hardcoded**: page routes, auth flow, title/icon/location heuristics, and layout behavior
- **reusable UI engine**: schema loading, `$ref` resolution, privacy filtering, schema forms, cards, action modal flow, map provider registry, and API clients

## Routes

| Path | Component | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `/` | `HomePage` | Browse network participants by domain in list or map mode |
| `/profile/new` | `ProfileFormPage` | Create an item/profile from a selected domain schema |
| `/profile/:id/edit` | `ProfileFormPage` | Edit an owned item/profile |
| `/auth/login` | `LoginPage` | Start email-or-phone OTP login or signup |
| `/auth/otp` | `OtpPage` | Verify OTP and persist the bearer token |
| `/my-actions` | `MyActionsPage` | Review initiated and received actions and update statuses |

`/profile/new`, `/profile/:id/edit`, and `/my-actions` are protected by `RequireAuth`.

The `?network=<name>` query param selects the active network when multiple configured networks are available. The `?as=<domain>` query param on `/` is a runtime override for the current browsing role. The `?domain=<domain>` param controls the selected target domain. The `?view=list|map` param controls the view mode.
